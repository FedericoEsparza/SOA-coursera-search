# SOA-coursera-search
Fast Prototype of a search app for Coursera courses still 
offering Statements of Accomplishment.

## Try it out here:
[soa-coursera-search.herokuapp.com](https://bit.ly/SOAcoursera)


Single Page Application developed with the use of javascript, jquery, JSON, ajax, and bootstrap.


**_UPDATE(5/20/2016):_** As of April, 2016, most Coursera courses no longer offer 
Statements of Accomplishment. The app still functions to find the very few remaining 
courses that do, and to search for courses in retrospect, going back to 2012.
 
Given this, the app will remain an archived prototype, and will not be developed further.
  
**_UPDATE(2/24/2018):_** Coursera retired their original API that served the back-end data for this app. App won't display any results in current state. Coursera has evolved significantly in the last several years; for better or worse.
